        <p>Short Biography
Prof. Goodrich received his B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Calvin University in 1983 and his PhD in Computer Science from Purdue University in 1987.
He is a Distinguished Professor at the University of California, Irvine, where he has been a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science since 2001. In addition, he currently serves as Technical Director for the ICS Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation. He was a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University from 1987 to 2001.

Dr. Goodrich's research is directed at the design of high performance algorithms and data structures with applications to information assurance and security, networking, machine learning, and geometric computing. He has pioneered and led research on efficient solutions to a number of fundamental problems, including sorting, convex hull construction, nearest-neighbor searching, linear programming, privacy-preserving data access, network traceback, and data authentication. His research has been supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Department of Defense, including the Army Research Office (ARO), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA)

With over 350 publications, including several widely-adopted books, his work includes contributions to efficient and secure distributed data structures, information privacy, social networks, and cloud security. He has served as a scientific consultant to AT&T, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and the National Science Foundation. He has experience as an expert witness in cases involving algorithms, cryptography, computer security, digital rights management (DRM), graphical user interfaces (GUIs), machine learning, networking and distributed computing, software, hospitality industry technology, audio/video processing, databases, and storage technologies. He is an ACM Distinguished Scientist, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), a Fulbright Scholar (with senior specialist service in Denmark), a Fellow of the IEEE, and a Fellow of the ACM. He is a recipient of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement Award, the Brown Univ. Award for Technological Innovation, and the Pond Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. In addition, he has been elected as a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.</p>

        <p>Roberto Tamassia is an American-Italian computer scientist, the Plastech Professor of Computer Science at Brown University, and served as the chair of the Brown Computer Science department from 2007 to 2014.[1] His research specialty is in the design and analysis of algorithms for graph drawing, computational geometry, and computer security. He is also the author of several textbooks.

Professional biography
Tamassia received a laurea (the Italian equivalent of an M.S. degree) from the University of Rome "La Sapienza" in 1984, and a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Franco Preparata in 1988.[1][2] He then took a faculty position at Brown; he has also held visiting positions at the University of Texas at Dallas, the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, and La Sapienza.[1]

Tamassia is an ISI highly cited researcher.[3] He was one of the original organizers of the International Symposium on Graph Drawing, and was co-chair of that conference in 1994; he has also been co-chair of the semiannual Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures (1997, 1999, and 2001) and the annual Workshop on Algorithms and Experiments (2005). He is founding editor-in-chief (since 1996) of the Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications[4] as well as belonging to several other journal editorial boards.

Awards and honors
In 2006, the IEEE Computer Society gave Tamassia their Technical Achievement Award "for pioneering the field of graph drawing and for outstanding contributions to the design of graph and geometric algorithms."[1][5] In 2008, he was elected as an IEEE Fellow.[1][6][7] In 2012 he was named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery "for contributions to graph drawing, algorithms and data structures and to computer science education",[8] and also named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[9]

Personal life
Tamassia was married to Isabel Cruz, also a noted computer scientist, until her death in 2021</p>
